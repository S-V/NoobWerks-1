# Engine Source Code

The "Developer" folder contains code that is used only during development (e.g. by tools/editor)
and shouldn't be used in the final game.

The "Runtime" folder contains the core (performance-sensitive) engine code.

The "Utility" folder contains utilities that can be used in the game.
